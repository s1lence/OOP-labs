Hi Looking for somerwere to advertise your Holiday Villa for rent. Dismayed by the
high cost of advertising and updates on the sites available. No leads generated form
your current adds.
Well now you have the chance to try our new service. I had the same problems as
yourself, paying high fees, with very little leads generated. Because of this I
decided to start my own site for owners world wide to advertise on. I decided to
produce the site for the owners, NO pages full of adverts, No difficulty in
navigation, Ease of use Owner interface. In fact everything to make advertising as
simple as possible. For the people looking to rent, things could not be easier. They
can search using a muli criteria form, or just follow the simple maps to find an
area they are interested in. Once they find what they are interested in, they can
then send an enquiry email to the owner, or phone them direct, or choose to send a
text message through our servers, totally free of charge.
It is TOTALLY FREE  to place your advert on the site, with up to 20 photo's and SMS
text alert service.
